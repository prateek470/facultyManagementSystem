Feature: add a page to assign courses to faculty members

 As admin of the Course Assignment System
 So that faculty can view courses assigned and choose their preferences
 I want to assign courses to faculty members

 Background: faculties and courses have been added to the database

   Given the following semesters exist:
   | SemesterTitle |
   | Fall 2015 |

   And the following faculties exist:
   | faculty_name |
   | faculty_1 |
   | Chen Jianer |
   | Ioerger Thomas |

   And the following courses exist:
   | course_name | CourseTitle |
   | CSCE 606 | test1 |
   | CSCE/ECEN 680 | test2 |
   | CSCE 629 | test3 |
   | CSCE 608 | test4 |
   | CSCE 625 | test5 |

   And the following faculty-course mappings exist:
   | faculty_id | course1_id | course2_id | course3_id | semester_id |
   | 2          | 3          | 4          |            | 1 	   |
   | 1 	      | 1	   | 2	        |	     | 1 	   |

   #And I am on the home page
   #When I choose semester "Fall 2015" and follow "Assign Faculty & Courses"
   #Then I am on the Course and Faculty page


# Scenario: selecting faculty
